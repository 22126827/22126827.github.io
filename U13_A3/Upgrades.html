<p>SAMSUNG:</p>
<p>The First Samsung Galaxy S (2010):</p>
<p>The first Samsung Galaxy, the Samsung S, was released in June 2010, and it was the company’s first serious foray into the high-end smartphone market. It featured a four-inch Super AMOLED display, which, at the time, was praised for its vibrant colors and deep blacks, setting a new standard for screens. Powered by a 1GHz processor and Android 2.1, the Galaxy S quickly gained traction for its speed, sleek design, and large, high-quality display.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S II & Galaxy Note (2011):</p>
<p>The Galaxy S II launched in April 2011, marking a big breakthrough in terms of performance and design. With a 4.3-inch display, the S II was thinner, lighter, and faster than its predecessor, making it one of the most popular Android phones of its time. The Super AMOLED Plus display took things up a notch, as did the 8MP camera. Later in 2011, the ever-popular Galaxy Note debuted. Boasting a 5.3-inch display and one-of-a-kind S Pen capabilities, it quickly created a cult-like following.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S III & Galaxy Note II (2012):</p>
<p>With its 4.8-inch HD Super AMOLED display, the S III broke new ground in screen size and quality, offering a larger and more immersive experience than ever before. Samsung also introduced "S Voice," its first built-in voice assistant. But perhaps the most memorable feature was the Smart Stay technology, which kept the screen lit up while you were looking at it. Later in the year, Samsung released the upgraded Galaxy Note II, boasting a 5.5-inch display and improved S Pen functionality.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S4 & Galaxy Note 3 (2013):</p>
<p>Sporting a 5-inch Full HD Super AMOLED display, it took the screen size even further while keeping a slim profile. The S4 was loaded with software enhancements like Air Gesture and Air View, which let you to interact with your phone without touching the screen. The phone's 13MP camera was also impressive at the time for its high-quality images and video features. Later in the year, the Note 3 made its appearance, delivering a bigger 5.7-inch display and better S Pen functionality and performance.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S5 & Galaxy Note 4 (2014):</p>
<p>was the first to have features like a heart rate monitor and Samsung Health, making it a popular choice with the fitness crowd. It was also the first Galaxy phone with water and dust resistance (IP67), and it also came with a fingerprint scanner embedded into the home button for added security. The camera got a boost with its 16MP rear camera, featuring faster autofocus and improved low-light performance. In October, the Galaxy Note 4 followed with its new QHD display and even more S Pen functions. </p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge & Galaxy Note5 (2015):</p>
<p>The S6 Edge debuted alongside the S6, introducing a new curved-edge design that would go on to be a staple of Samsung's flagship phones. The S6 also featured fast charging and wireless charging capabilities. In August, Galaxy Note5 (with the space between Note and 5 suddenly gone) debuted with an improved S Pen experience and other upgraded features.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge & Galaxy Note7 (2016):</p>
<p>he S7 Edge had a more pronounced curved display, while both models kept their sleek glass-and-metal design. A better camera with larger pixels was baked in, boosting low-light performance, and a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED screen made for a more vivid viewing experience. The S7 was also the first Galaxy phone to bring back the microSD card slot, a fan-favorite that had been left out of the 5 and 6 series. Water resistance and fast charging were once again featured, making the S7 series a top contender for the best smartphone of 2016. The latest Galaxy Note7 (which skipped ahead in number to keep up with the rest) also debuted.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S8 Series, Galaxy Note8 & A Series (2017):</p>
<p>With its edge-to-edge Infinity Display and almost no bezels, the S8 inspired a shift toward full-screen designs across the industry. Samsung also introduced the Bixby virtual assistant. In September, the Galaxy Note8, with its dual cameras and upgraded S-Pen features, debuted. Also new this year were Galaxy A-series phones (A3 & A5), which offered slightly pared-down features for those who wanted a little high-end tech at a lower price.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S9 Series, Galaxy Note9 & A Series (2018):</p>
<p>The S9’s revolutionary variable aperture camera was able to adjust the lens to capture more light in low-light conditions. The S9+ featured dual cameras for the first time in the Galaxy S series, allowing for better zoom and portrait shots. The design remained similar to the S8, but the performance improvements and camera capabilities were enough to make the S9 series the most popular smartphones at the time. The Note9 came out in August 2018, promising all-day battery life, a Bluetooth-ready S Pen, and better performance. The Galaxy A Series got a boost with four new phones (A6, A6+, A7, and A8).</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S10 Series, Galaxy Note10, Z Fold & A Series (2019):</p>
<p> The S10e delivered a more affordable choice, as did the S10 Lite, while the S10 and S10+ were packed with cutting-edge technology. The S10 series also marked the beginning of 5G connectivity, paving the way for faster download speeds and more responsive networks. The Galaxy Note10  also debuted this year, along with a more affordable Note10 Lite version, and a premium Plus version, which boasted a larger 6.8-inch AMOLED display and a bigger battery. Also making its first appearance was the Galaxy Z Fold phone, Samsung’s first-ever foldable device, which opened like a book but with an inward-folding hinge, making it a truly innovative addition to the lineup. The Galaxy A series also introduced some new phones (A10, A20, A30, A50, and A70).</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S20 Series, Z Flip, Z Fold2, Galaxy Note20 & A Series (2020):</p>
<p>was one of Samsung’s most ambitious launches, with the introduction of 5G across the entire lineup. The S20 Ultra, in particular, had a lot of people talking, thanks to its 108MP quad camera and 100x Space Zoom. The S20 series was the first to sport a 120Hz refresh rate display, providing ultra-smooth visuals and a better all-around user experience. A Fan Edition (FE) phone also debuted in the S series and continues throughout each series today, offering some, but not all, of the same great features of the flagship phones at a lower price. Also, making its entrance that year was the innovative Galaxy Z Flip, a retro-style flip-phone but with advanced features. The Galaxy Note20 and 20 Ultra entered the fray with even more upgraded options for fans, as did the Galaxy Z Fold2 and even more Galaxy A-series phones.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S21 Series, Z Flip3, Z Fold3 & A Series (2021):</p>
<p>The S21 and S21+ models both had a 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED display, while the S21 Ultra took things further with a 108MP camera, 100x zoom, and much to the delight of many, the introduction of S Pen support (previously exclusive to the Note series, which had been retired). The S21 series also was the first to not come with a charger in the box, a move that drew mixed reactions. The Galaxy Z Fold3 and Z Flip3 (it skipped a release year), became more durable, more water resistant, and offered S Pen support. The budget-friendly Galaxy A-series and S-series FE phones continued to roll out, as well.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S22 Series, Z Fold4, Z Flip4 & A Series (2022):</p>
<p>the Galaxy S22 series built upon the design and performance enhancements of the S21s, but with better cameras, software, and more premium designs. The S22 Ultra embraced the Note series legacy by integrating the S Pen directly into the device. The S22 Ultra's 108MP camera and advanced low-light photography made it one of the best camera phones available, while the S22 and S22+ offered more compact options for those who preferred a smaller device and didn’t need an S Pen on board. The Z Flip4 and Z Fold4 continued to make headlines with new upgrades and the ability to transform into bigger-than-life smartphones. Meantime, the more budget friendly Galaxy A-series and S-series FE phone options kept coming.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S23 Series, Z Fold5, Z Flip5 & More (2023):</p>
<p> the Galaxy S23 series brought more powerful performance with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. The S23 Ultra, with its 200MP camera and incredible zoom capabilities, was a standout, offering unparalleled photo quality. With improved battery life, the latest version of One UI, and support for satellite connectivity, the S23 series was Samsung’s most refined and feature-packed flagship lineup yet. Samsung continued to improve its innovative Galaxy Z Fold5 and Z Flip5 phones in the form of upgraded displays and functionality, while more A-series and S-series FE phones came down the line.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S24 Series, Z Fold6, Z Flip6 & More (2024):</p>
<p>the Galaxy S24 series arrived—and artificial intelligence took center stage. With the addition of Galaxy AI features, including Google Circle to Search, AI-assisted note-taking, translation features, generative photo edit capabilities, and beyond, Galaxy AI was all the talk. Also on tap were the Z Fold6 and Z Flip6, with even more capabilities and many of the same Galaxy AI features baked in. Every one of these phones featured the most advanced processor of its time: the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, designed to power the latest AI technology. It was also the first series of phones to come with seven years of Android and security updates standard. More A-series and S-series FE phones also rolled out for budget-minded fans.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Series (2025):</p>
<p>he S25 series took center stage with super-evolved Galaxy AI in tow, offering upgrades across all the phones and creating a true AI companion. Google Gemini became more lifelike and intuitive, able to handle multiple tasks across apps with one voice command. The AI-enhanced, pro-style cameras delivered stunning photos with more accurate skin tones and lifelike textures. Features like Nightography and Audio Eraser allowed users to capture memories in almost any condition—day or night—without the need for time-consuming edits. 

Every phone in the series came with the upgraded processor needed to power it all: the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. The Ultra received significant upgrades, featuring a larger 6.9-inch screen with anti-reflective Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass, a refined design with smoother, more rounded corners, and a 50MP Ultra-Wide camera—Samsung's highest resolution to date. ProScaler debuted on both the S25 Ultra and the S25+, enhancing image detail and colors for more brilliant displays. The entry-level S25 also saw improvements, offering 12GB of RAM out of the box—an upgrade from the standard 8GB.</p>

It’s incredible to see how far smartphones have come in just 15 years. What was once considered cutting-edge—like 1GHz processors and tiny displays—paved the way for innovations like foldable, tablet-like screens, advanced AI processors, pro-style cameras, and beyond. The journey of the Galaxy series is a testament to how technology will continue to morph and reshape our lives.</p></h3>
